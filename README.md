## breakdown-free-GMRES-for-mean-variance-efficient-portfolios
This code was developed for the free homework in the course of Computational Linear Algebra for Large Scale Problems. It essentially replicates the results found on two articles about a variant of gmres applied to a financial problem. Useful links about the paper can be found in the dija_application.m file while the dataset used is already uploaded in the material.
